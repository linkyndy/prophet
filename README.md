# Prophet

Prophet interprets a custom-tailored questionnaire DSL and launches an interactive GUI. It is a toy project implemented to showcase the steps of writing an interpreter using beautiful and idiomatic Ruby code.

The basic flavour of the DSL looks like this:

```
form festivalParticipationSurvey
  "Did you participate in a festival last year?"
    bool participatedLastYear

  if participatedLastYear
    "How many festivals did you participate in?"
      number numberOfFestivals

    "How much did you spend on average per tickets?"
      number spendingOnTickets => 1 + (100 * 2)

    "How much did you spend on average on the festival site?"
      number spendingAtFestival => 500

    "This means you've spent a total of:"
      number spendingTotal => (spendingOnTickets + spendingAtFestival)
  else
    "You really need to go to a festival. Type one festival you would like to attend:"
      text festivalName => "Tomorrowland, Defqon.1, ..."
  end
end
```

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'prophet'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install prophet

## Usage

```ruby
Prophet.interpret('examples/sample.ql')
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
